                    	Beneufit's mission is to empower people to improve their medical condition through exercise, while supporting vital public health research in an open and ongoing fashion. Our approach is unique in that we prescribe disease-specific exercise interventions and track outcomes through a series of objective measures.
                    	We developed a system using computer vision and machine learning technologies which could predict level of dyskenisia and hence help to diagnose parkinson's disease in a person. The technology is capable enough to make measurements only using a mobile phone camera and hence making it a completely automatic process to measure parkinson's disease.

                    <p class="pubd">
                    	Developing recommendation system for fashion images is
challenging due to the inherent ambiguity associated with
what criterion a user is looking at. Suggesting multiple
images where each output image is similar to the query image
on the basis of a different feature or part is one way
to mitigate the problem. Existing works for fashion recommendation
have used Siamese or Triplet network to learn
features between a similar pair and a similar-dissimilar triplet
respectively. However, these methods do not provide basic
information such as, how two clothing images are similar,
or which parts present in the two images make them similar.
In this paper, we propose to recommend images by
explicitly learning and exploiting part based similarity. We
propose a novel approach of learning discriminative features
from weakly-supervised data by using visual attention over
the parts and a texture encoding network. We show that the
learned features surpass the state-of-the-art in retrieval task
on DeepFashion dataset. We then use the proposed model to
recommend fashion images having an explicit variation with
respect to similarity of any of the parts

                    <p class="pubd">With the advent of self-driving cars and autonomous robots, it is imperative to detect road impairments like cracks and potholes and to perform necessary evading maneuvers to ensure fluid journey for on-board passengers or equipment. We propose a fully autonomous robust real-time road crack and pothole detection algorithm which can be deployed on any GPU based conventional processing boards with an associated camera. The approach is based on a deep neural net architecture which detects cracks and potholes using texture and spatial features. We also propose pre-processing methods which ensure real-time performance. The novelty of the approach lies in using texture- based features to differentiate between crack surfaces and sound roads. The approach performs well in large viewpoint changes, background noise, shadows, and occlusion. The efficacy of the system is shown on standard road crack datasets.

                    <p class="pubd">In the previous decade, there has been a considerable rise in the usage of smartphones.Due to exorbitant advancement in technology, computational speed and quality of image capturing has increased considerably. With an increase in the need for remote fingerprint verification, smartphones can be used as a powerful alternative for fingerprint authentication instead of conventional optical sensors. In this research, wepropose a technique to capture finger-images from the smartphones and pre-process them in such a way that it can be easily matched with the optical sensor images.Effective finger-image capturing, image enhancement, fingerprint pattern extraction, core point detection and image alignment techniques have been discussed. The proposed approach has been validated on FVC 2004 DB1 & DB2 dataset and the results show the efficacy of the methodology proposed. The method can be deployed for real-time commercial usage.

                            <p>The AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) team of Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering) has taken up an innovation project to develop a fully - autonomous underwater vehicle. I worked as an image processing engineer in the team. DTU-AUV was ranked 9th (2008) and 14th (2009) and went till the semifinals in 2013 out of 32 global teams at the RoboSub international competition organized by the AUVSI Foundation (Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International) and the ONR (Office of Naval Research) held annually at San Diego, California.
                                <p> I wrote image processing codes in C++ OpenCV that would help an autonomous underwater vehicle to detect yaw angles and calculate drift while navigating.To improve the quality of results image enhancement algorithms like CLAHE were applied. The results were communicated to the vehicle using UART serial communication.</p>

                            <p>GARUDA, a modified Sig Rascal 110 R/C aircraft along with its Ground Control System is capable of performing
                                autonomous flight & navigation, simultaneously gathering actionable surveillance data using optical sensors.
                                The system includes commercially available autopilot system, Piccolo II for control & navigation with a customized
                                imagery system capable of capturing & transmitting high definition images of the hostile territory simultaneously
                                processing it to deliver actionable intelligence. The Ground Control Station (GCS) and the aircraft communicate
                                in real time to provide situational awareness and safe and reliable flight. Due to it's modular design, the entire system
                                can be brought to a flying state in less than 20 minutes. We participated with this system in Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) 2012 competition and secured 3rd position.</p>
                            
                            <p> Garuda was developed as part of the Unmanned Aerial Systems - Delhi Technological University (UAS-DTU) project. UAS-DTU is a team of undergraduate students of Delhi Technological University, devoted to developing indigenous technological solutions for UAVs. Our ultimate goal was to reduce India's reliance on off-the-shelf products and foreign UAVs. Focussing on humanitarian uses of UAVs, we are developing a new generation of low-cost Image Processing and Flight Control Systems to aid in Surveillance and Reconnaissance.</p>

                            <p>The team, under mentorship and funding from Lockheed Martin, is the first to develop a Next Generation Urban UAS - Aarush X1, that is tailor- made for surveillance in urban jungles like Delhi and Mumbai. The team signed its first MoU with Lockheed Martin in 2009. The second MoU was signed in 2013, under which a new version of Aarush (Aarush X2) is being developed. The team annually participates in AUVSIs SUAS competition, which stands for Student Unmanned Aerial Systems competition. The competition is held in Maryland, USA where more than 30 universities come every year with their UAVs hoping to win the competition. We are the first team from India to participate in this competition (Our first participation was in 2009), and also the first team from India to achieve a podium finish (We were ranked 3rd in 2012). In 2013, the team ranked 6th. After these years of experience through the competition and Lockheed Martin project, we are now capable of manufacturing Unmanned Aerial Systems for the market with the capabilities of Aerial Imagery, and GCS Softwares for the processing of these images.</p>

                            <p>
                                The real-time chat interface is built using Node.js and Socket.io. We use Redis to maintain a pool of images for live HITs and all data finally resides in a MySQL database.
                                <br><br>
                                A database table stores images from the COCO dataset each with a randomly picked caption. A batch of images from this table are then pushed to a Redis list for launching HITs. The web server corresponding to the chat interface pairs two AMT workers, assigns them roles (questioner or answerer) and shows corresponding interface, picks an image from the Redis list to collect data on and saves their conversation in the database, also marking that image as 'complete' once the HIT is done. This happens in parallel so workers aren't left waiting, and the server ensures workers have unique ids. Disconnects are handled gracefully — remaining worker is asked to continue asking questions or providing facts (captions) up to 10 messages. Once the HITs are complete, scripts in mturk_scripts/approve can be used to review, approve, reject HITs and pay workers.

                            <p> Trippr is a collaborative trip planning app powered by IBM Watson based personal assistant. This app was developed while participating 
                            in Angel Hacks, Seattle - a 24 hour hackathon in the summer of 2013. It consisted of a combination of Android app, Pebble Smartwatch app and a Web app through which
                            people can chat online with their friends, ask questions to a smart personal assistant and book iteneraries. </p>

                            <p> The personal assistant powered by IBM Watson can hold conversation with the group of users to suggest popular destinations, restaurants, cheapest flights. It also automatically built an itenerary based on users choices. This app provided smart features similar to Google Trips.</p>

                            <p> Our app also won the "Best use of Respoke API" award.</p>
